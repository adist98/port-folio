Currently, I am working with a startup in Bangalore as a Product\n        Solutions Engineer. Currently my tech stack consits of{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>Google Firebase</b>,{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>BigQuery</b>,{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>MetaBase</b>,{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>Node</b>,{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>C++</b>, etc. My work involves playing with{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>JavaScript</b> in creative ways and coming\n        up with scalabe solutions. I am also learning the MERN stack.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        Currently I am also working on an exciting personal project called\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}> pZEROrn </b>. This project uses the\n        complete MERN stack and pretty soon I'll be able to showcase my creation\n        to the whole world. I am really excited for this project\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        My hobbies include playing chess, taking part in various competitive\n        programming contests, listening to rap, reading Nietzsche. Out of all\n        the hobbies mentioned I love competitive programming the most. I treat\n        it as an actual sport and that mindset has helped me develop my\n        algorithmic skills to a great extent.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Before working as a Dev - cum - Product Solutions Engineer and diving\n        deep into comp sci, I worked for a Quant/Finance firm called{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>Futures First</b> as an Analyst. I\n        developed algorithms that can trade in FX, US and UK interest rate\n        markets with an efficiency of more than 60 pct. It was an amalgamation\n        of software developing and good'ol statistics. But it was at Futures\n        First where I realised that my true calling was tech. I wanted to build\n        products that can have a lasting impact on people and change their lives\n        for better. Soon I'll introduce my current project\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>pZEROrn</b> which I am really excited\n        about.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I've also worked at{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>DRDO - Defense Lab Jodhpur</b>, where I was\n        a part of it's NRMA department. NRMA takes care of all the research\n        related to <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>Nuclear Radiation</b>. During my\n        time at DRDO, I worked under{\" \"}\n        <b style={{ color: \"pink\" }}>Dr. D.K. Gupta (Sc. E)</b>. My research\n        work involved building up apparatus to perform gamma ray spectroscopy\n        and observe the performance of Amptek A350 chip to detect radioactive\n        sources. I really enjoyed my time at DRDO, but one thing you must know\n        about Jodhpur is that it gets very hot during the summers and sometimes\n        it gets almost impossible to beat the heat. So just keep that lemonade\n        with you all the time if you're in Jodhpur.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        I am always open for new and exciting opportunites and would love to\n        connect with you if you have something exciting to share.
